This project leverages Machine Learning to predict whether a mushroom is edible or poisonous based on its physical characteristics. Using a dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, we trained models to help foragers and researchers identify safe mushrooms.
<h3>Objective</h3>
<li>
  <ol>Analyze the dataset to extract meaningful insights.</ol>
  <ol>Train machine learning models to classify mushrooms.</ol>
  <ol>Deploy a predictive system for real-world use.</ol>
